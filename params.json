  "body": "# Omnicatz Inventory System\r\nA simple system using a standard barcode scanner and dymo labelmanager to keep a database of for tracking object and containers.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to only track where an item was last... One never actually track when one remove an item unless it purged totally from the system.\r\n\r\n[Label Printer](https://www.amazon.com/DYMO-LabelManager-Label-Maker-1768960/dp/B00464E5P2)\r\n\r\n[Barcode scanner](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/USB-Negative-film-scanner-portable-barcode-scanner-scaner-barcode-reader-Bar-Code-scanner-leitor-de-codigo/32452127851.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.96.dNMKfI)\r\n\r\nAdditionally I am working on a Phone app mostly for simpler operations like moving items that already exist to another container also I want to add functionality so it can substitute the barcode scanner. \r\n\r\nTo do this I am integrating a http server with the PC app so it serves as a server probably running in the tray later on and with an option to launch on start.\r\n\r\nI am also planing on a low budget option of pre-printing barcodes using a regular printer where by one would print a whole bunch of them at a time then cut them out as needed and glue them on.",
